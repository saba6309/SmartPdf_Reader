SmartPDF Reader
SmartPDF Reader is an AI-powered chatbot that enables you to chat with your PDF documents. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture powered by Google Gemini for intelligent, contextual answers based on your uploaded PDFs — resumes, reports, or academic papers.

Motivation
Reading lengthy PDFs manually is slow and inefficient — especially when you're looking for specific information. SmartPDF Reader transforms PDFs into interactive knowledge bases using a chat interface powered by modern language models and RAG architecture.

🤖 What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines:

Retrieval: Pulling relevant chunks from your PDFs using semantic search via FAISS and Google embeddings.

Generation: Feeding that retrieved context into a language model (Google Gemini) to generate an accurate, grounded response.

This enables high-quality, contextual answers that are anchored in your documents.

Upload[📄 User uploads PDFs] --> Extract[🔍 Text extracted using PyPDF2]
Extract --> Split[✂️ Text split into chunks (LangChain Splitter)]
Split --> Embed[🔡 Chunks embedded using Gemini Embeddings]
Embed --> Store[🧠 Stored in FAISS Vector DB]
Question[❓ User asks a question] --> Search[🔎 FAISS similarity search]
Search --> Retrieve[📚 Retrieve top relevant chunks]
Retrieve --> Generate[🧠 Gemini LLM processes context + question]
Generate --> Answer[💬 Final answer returned to Streamlit UI]
